# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Bakr Bouhaya

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- The UI/UX of the app is bad, but the styling can be improved by choosing the theme of the app and choosing the right colors.
- I think it would be good to have it sorted by alphabet

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

**I shared the file in Google Drive since the file is bigger and has a gif, and the image required a very lower file size, so I uploaded it to Google Drive to share it as a video. It is the only way.**


## Notes

My challenge was understanding the challenger well enough to write the code correctly; I had so many errors but overcame them since I spent a lot of time planning and organizing my thoughts to solve the problem. Also, I struggled to upload the GIF file to Imgur since the GIF file is a considerable size.
